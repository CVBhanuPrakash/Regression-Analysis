# Regression-Analysis
 
This project was about doing proper data pre-processing and find the relation 
between each weather parameters in the Daily Climate time series data. The 4 
parameters here are mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, mean pressure 
of 4 years. Doing Relational Analysis with Simple Linear and Simple non-linear 
Regression Analysis approaches, calculate R square values in each case and 
conclude the results precisely. Non-linear regression gives better prediction 
curve than in linear regression.
