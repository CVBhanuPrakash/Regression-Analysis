# Regression Analysis

This project focuses on comprehensive data pre-processing and uncovering the relationships among various weather parameters within the Daily Climate time series data. The dataset includes four essential parameters: mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure, collected over four years. The project employs both Simple Linear and Simple Non-linear Regression Analysis approaches to establish relationships, calculate R-squared values for each case, and draw precise conclusions.

## Project Objectives:

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

- Data Pre-processing: Perform thorough data pre-processing to ensure the data's quality and suitability for analysis.

- Relational Analysis: Explore the relationships between different weather parameters to gain insights into their dependencies.

- Regression Analysis: Apply Simple Linear and Simple Non-linear Regression Analysis techniques to model and predict these relationships.

- Evaluate Results: Calculate R-squared values to quantify the goodness of fit and make informed conclusions.

## Course Project:

I completed this project as part of my "Introduction to Data Analytics" course. It showcases my proficiency in data analysis, regression techniques, and the ability to draw meaningful insights from real-world datasets.

This project demonstrates my analytical skills and the application of statistical techniques in deriving valuable insights from climate data.
